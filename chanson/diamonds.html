     <h4>Les paroles</h4>
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Find light in the beautiful sea
    I choose to be happy
    You and I, you and I
    We're like diamonds in the sky
    You're a shooting star I see
    A vision of ecstasy
    When you hold me, I'm alive
    We're like diamonds in the sky
    I knew that we'd become one right away
    Oh, right away
    At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
    I saw the life inside your eyes
    So shine bright, tonight you and I
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Eye to eye, so alive
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh)
    Shining bright like a diamond
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh)
    Shining bright like a diamond
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Palms rise to the universe
    As we moonshine and molly
    Feel the warmth, we'll never die
    We're like diamonds in the sky
    You're a shooting star I see
    A vision of ecstasy
    When you hold me, I'm alive
    We're like diamonds in the sky
    At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
    I saw the life inside your eyes
    So shine bright, tonight you and I
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Eye to eye, so alive
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh)
    Shining bright like a diamond
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh)
    Shining bright like a diamond
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
    So shine bright, tonight you and I
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Eye to eye, so alive
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh)
    Shine bright like a diamond, whoa oh yeah
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
    Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh, oh)
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
